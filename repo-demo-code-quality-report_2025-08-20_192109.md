## üìà QUALITY METRICS

| Metric | Score | Industry Standard | Notes |
|--------|-------|------------------|-------|
| Code Coverage | 75% | >80% | Aim for higher coverage in critical modules |
| Complexity | Medium | Low-Medium | Refactor complex functions |
| Documentation | Good | Comprehensive | Improve inline comments |
| Maintainability | Medium | High | Reduce technical debt |
| Technical Debt | Medium | Low | Address identified code smells |

---

## üöÄ RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the analysis, here are actionable recommendations to improve code quality:

1. **Short-term Wins**
   - Apply consistent naming conventions
   - Remove duplicated code blocks
   - Add more inline comments to complex functions

2. **Medium-term Improvements**
   - Refactor large functions into smaller, testable units
   - Improve error handling with specific error types
   - Centralize dependency management

3. **Long-term Initiatives**
   - Enforce coding standards with linters and formatters
   - Implement a comprehensive testing strategy
   - Regularly review and address technical debt

## üìù CONCLUSION

This report was generated using the repo-demo-code-analysis template from the Ask-Plan-Repo Demo Series. It provides an assessment based on the specified focus areas and principles.

**Try different parameters:**
```bash
# Get a different focus for code quality analysis:
./run-prompt.sh repo-demo --focus="security vulnerabilities" --principles="OWASP Top 10" --language="TypeScript"

# Or try the other templates in this series:
./run-prompt.sh ask-demo  # For project briefing
./run-prompt.sh plan-demo # For feature implementation planning
```

_Remember: Code quality is a journey, not a destination!_ üöÄ
