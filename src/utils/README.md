# Utility Functions - Reusable Components

This directory contains general-purpose shell utility functions designed for reuse across multiple projects.

See the [cursor-project-boilerplate](https://github.com/pequet/cursor-project-boilerplate) repository for more details.

## Files Overview

- **`file_utils.sh`** - File operations and path handling utilities
- **`input_utils.sh`** - User input processing and validation
- **`logging_utils.sh`** - Logging and output formatting functions
- **`messaging_utils.sh`** - User communication and error messaging
- **`system_utils.sh`** - System detection and platform utilities

## Purpose

These utilities provide common functionality that can be shared across different shell script projects. They implement standard patterns for file handling, user interaction, logging, and system operations.

## Usage

These files are sourced by the project-specific scripts in the parent `src/` directory and can be reused in other projects that need similar functionality.
