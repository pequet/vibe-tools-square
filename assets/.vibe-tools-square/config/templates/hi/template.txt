Hi this is a template for testing whatever happens with "double quotes", 'single quotes' and `backticks` in the template.

As well as in variables:

1. {{STRING1}}
2. {{STRING2}}
3. {{STRING3}}

Could you see without weird artifacts such as weird escaping of quotes the three words above? What are these three words?
