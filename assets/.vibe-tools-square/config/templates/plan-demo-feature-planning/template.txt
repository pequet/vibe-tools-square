- {{DEPENDENCIES}}

## üöÄ IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH

### 1. Discovery Phase (10% of timeline)
- [ ] Review existing codebase and identify integration points
- [ ] Analyze potential technical challenges
- [ ] Define technical boundaries and interfaces
- [ ] Create detailed technical specification

### 2. Setup & Foundation (15% of timeline)
- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Create branch strategy for collaborative development
- [ ] Scaffold necessary files and components
- [ ] Set up testing framework for the feature

### 3. Core Implementation (40% of timeline)
- [ ] Implement data models and persistence layer
- [ ] Develop business logic and service layer
- [ ] Create necessary APIs and endpoints
- [ ] Implement frontend components and user interactions
- [ ] Integrate with dependent systems

### 4. Testing & Refinement (25% of timeline)
- [ ] Write unit tests for all components
- [ ] Perform integration testing
- [ ] Conduct performance testing
- [ ] Address edge cases and error handling
- [ ] Optimize for performance and scalability

### 5. Finalization (10% of timeline)
- [ ] Documentation updates
- [ ] Code review and cleanup
- [ ] Final QA testing
- [ ] Prepare for deployment
- [ ] Create rollback plan

## üß† TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS

### Potential Challenges
1. **Integration Complexity**: How the feature integrates with existing systems
2. **Performance Implications**: Impact on system performance
3. **Scalability Concerns**: How the feature will scale with increasing load
4. **Security Considerations**: Potential security implications
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensuring compatibility with existing features

### Technical Decisions
1. **Data Storage**: Where and how data will be stored
2. **API Design**: Design principles for any new APIs
3. **Authentication/Authorization**: Security requirements
4. **Caching Strategy**: Approach to caching for performance
5. **Error Handling**: Strategy for handling exceptions and errors

## üìà METRICS & SUCCESS CRITERIA

How we'll measure success:

1. **Functional Criteria**
   - Feature works as specified in all test cases
   - Zero high-priority bugs

2. **Performance Criteria**
   - Response time under threshold
   - Resource utilization within acceptable limits

3. **User Experience Criteria**
   - Positive feedback from user testing
   - Meets accessibility standards

## üåü BONUS: IMPLEMENTATION TIPS

* Break down large tasks into smaller, manageable chunks
* Commit code frequently with descriptive commit messages
* Document design decisions and trade-offs
* Consider creating a feature flag for gradual rollout
* Don't forget to write tests for edge cases!
