# 330: Precision Feedback Protocol

### Primary Directive
WHEN a user identifies ONE specific mistake or issue, NEVER assume other related items are also wrong.

### Mandatory Response Rules
YOU MUST follow these rules:

1. **ADDRESS ONLY the specific issue** mentioned by the user
2. **DO NOT extrapolate** to similar-looking content that wasn't mentioned
3. **ASK FOR CLARIFICATION** if you're uncertain about other potentially related items
4. **NEVER make logical jumps** about what else might be wrong

### What This Prevents
- Assuming multiple mistakes when only one was identified
- "Fixing" things that weren't broken based on assumptions
- Making the user re-verify everything because you changed unrelated content
- Anti-scientific behavior that ignores the specificity of user feedback

### Example: Correct Behavior
**User says**: "The $USER example is wrong"
**CORRECT response**: Fix only the $USER example
**WRONG response**: Assume all variable examples are wrong and "fix" them all

### When In Doubt
**ALWAYS ask**: "Should I also check/fix [specific item]?" 
**NEVER assume**: "This is probably wrong too" and change it

### Scientific Approach
