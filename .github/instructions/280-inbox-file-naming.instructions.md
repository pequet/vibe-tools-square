# 280: Inbox File Naming Convention

### Purpose
To ensure consistent and informative naming for all files placed in the `inbox/` directory, facilitating organization and retrieval.

### Naming Convention
Files added to the `inbox/` directory MUST follow this naming pattern:
`YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-description-of-contents.[original_extension]`

-   **`YYYY-MM-DD`**: The date the file was added.
-   **`HHMM`**: The time the file was added (24-hour format).
-   **`description-of-contents`**: A brief, hyphenated, lowercase description (e.g., `vibe-tools-analysis`, `meeting-notes`).
-   **`[original_extension]`**: The file's original extension (`.md`, `.txt`, etc.).

**Note:** The `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM` portion MUST be generated by fetching the current date and time using a system command, as per rule `207-timestamp-accuracy-protocol.instructions.md`.

### Examples
-   `2025-04-27_1430-vibe-tools-codebase-analysis.md`
-   `2025-04-28_0900-brainstorming-session-alpha-feature.txt`
-   `2025-04-01_1745-api-response-schema.json`

### Automation
All tools or scripts that save files to the `inbox/` MUST adhere to this naming convention.

### Inbox File Frontmatter Requirements
In addition to the naming convention, all files in the `inbox/` directory MUST include the following frontmatter:

```yaml
---
type: capture
domain: inbox
subject: Vibe-Tools Square
status: new
summary: Brief note on what was captured or why.
# priority: [1-4] # Optional
# source: [URL or reference] # Optional
---
```

This frontmatter helps in triaging and processing inbox items effectively.
