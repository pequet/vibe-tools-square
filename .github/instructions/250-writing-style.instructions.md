# 250: Writing Style Standard

### Directive
APPLY the following principles to ALL written content, including code comments, documentation, READMEs, status updates, and all AI-generated text.

### Core Principles
All writing MUST be:

1.  **HELPFUL:** Ensure the information is useful, relevant, and directly meets the audience's needs.
2.  **EFFICIENT (Concise):** Make it as short as possible while still being complete. ELIMINATE unnecessary words, phrases, and jargon.
3.  **DIRECT:** State the main point clearly and upfront. USE active voice.
4.  **MEANINGFUL (No Fluff):** Ensure all content is meaningful. REMOVE any filler, redundancy, or overly casual/verbose language.
5.  **COMPLETE:** Provide all necessary information for the context. AVOID missing steps or details.
6.  **ACTIONABLE:** Ensure the reader (human or AI) can easily understand and act upon the information. Make it clear what to do next.

### Application
-   Strictly adhere to these standards for all written output within the project.
-   USE these principles for self-correction and in peer review of written materials.
