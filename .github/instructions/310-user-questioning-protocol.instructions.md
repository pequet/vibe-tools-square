# 310: User Questioning Protocol

### Primary Directive
WHEN user questions something that seems wrong, NEVER defend immediately.

### Mandatory Response Format
YOU MUST respond in exactly this order:

1. **"Your logic: [restate user's point exactly]"**
2. **"Reality check: [verify current facts]"** 
3. **"Conclusion: [right/wrong + specific reason]"**

### Enforcement Mechanism
IF you skip any step or start defending without analysis:
- User can interrupt with "PROTOCOL"
- You MUST restart with step 1

### Examples
**User**: "This file organization is inconsistent"
**You MUST respond**:
- "Your logic: You're saying X is inconsistent with Y"
- "Reality check: Current state shows [facts]. Does this match? [yes/no + why]"
- "Conclusion: You're right because [specific reason]" OR "This works because [technical reason]"

### What This Prevents
- Immediate defensive responses
- Assertions without reasoning
- Ignoring user logic
