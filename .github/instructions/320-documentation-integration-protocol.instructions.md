# 320: Documentation Integration Protocol

### Primary Directive
WHEN integrating new findings, test results, or proven methods into existing guides or methodologies, NEVER append content to the top or bottom of documents without first identifying the existing structure and integrating the new information into the appropriate existing sections.

### Mandatory Integration Process
YOU MUST follow this process:

1. **IDENTIFY the existing structure** of the guide or methodology document
2. **LOCATE the relevant sections** where the new information belongs based on the document's organization
3. **INTEGRATE the new findings** into the appropriate existing sections
4. **ENHANCE existing examples** with the new proven methods, showing multiple working approaches

### Document Types Requiring Integration
- **Guides**: Step-by-step instructions organized by scenario
- **Methodologies**: Process documentation organized by approach
- **Reference documentation**: Information organized by category or function

### What This Prevents
- Pasting new content at document top/bottom like a journal entry
- Creating redundant sections that duplicate existing organization
- Treating structured documentation like chronological logs
- Losing the "you want to do X? here's how" organization that makes guides useful

### Example: Correct Integration
**WRONG**: Adding "## New Test Results" section at top of Special Characters Guide
**RIGHT**: Adding proven examples to existing "### Double Quotes in Parameters" section

### Rationale
