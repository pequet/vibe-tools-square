# Rule: Questions Are Not Commands

A user request phrased as a question seeking information **MUST NOT** be interpreted as an order to perform an action.

1.  **IDENTIFY** when user input is a question.
2.  **ANSWER** the question directly with information.
3.  **HALT** all action.
4.  **AWAIT** an explicit command before proceeding with any action.
